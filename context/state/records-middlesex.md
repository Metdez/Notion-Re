# State · Records — The Middlesex Corporation

> **Holds:** the Middlesex dedup ledger — every record created/updated in the 2026-06-10 load, with Notion IDs, so the next session deduplicates before touching a Middlesex record.
> **Ground truth:** `Enlaye Notion/The Middlesex Corp/Middlesex.md` (single-line JSON dossier, run_date 2026-06-10; **truncated mid-`sources` array** but all company/divisions/locations/projects/events/memberships/software/owners present). Dossier index: [research-files](research-files.md).
> **Part of:** [STATE.md](../../STATE.md) · map: [MAP.md](../MAP.md) · siblings: the other `records-*` ledgers (closest analog: [records-branch](records-branch.md) — Company-Map profile variant + existing company stub + interlink ADDs).

## Company record (EXISTING — extend, do not recreate)
**"The Middlesex Corporation"** `1ce90644-d524-809e-ab40-e6e6c0a21c76` in Companies full database. Pre-load: BW Category=[Builder] · Country=[Massachusetts, USA] · Size=**Local** · LinkedIn + Website set · People(4 existing) · Strategy→`24e90644…b598` · Description + body **empty**. Placeholder grey icon.
- ⚠ **Distinct from "The Middlesex Corporation"** `24e90644-d524-8090-b154-d6aa6301b598` — a row in the **Strategy** CRM DB (`collection://22590644-…`) under Business Development → Coordinated Attacks. NOT a Companies-DB duplicate. Left untouched. Holds a leadership table (Robert W. Pereira founder/CEO; Robert Pereira II Pres/COO; Dave Socci SVP; Joshua Wernig SVP/CLO; Tom Donaruma HR Dir — all w/ LinkedIns) — useful people source but NOT in dossier, so not loaded as People records.
- **Size=Local kept** vs dossier (Regional, $566.7M, ENR #222, ~850 emp). Conflict flagged, not overwritten.

## Projects (18 new + 3 existing-linked = 21 — Construction Projects DB) ✅ all carry Contractors→Middlesex
**Existing JV (Middlesex added as 2nd contractor alongside Cianbro):** PNSY Dry Dock `…1919cbb9b` · WALK `…ffedb5fb4c91` · TIME-2 `…b706eaee3a`.

*Owning Department left empty (relates to Companies DB, not page-local divisions); division↔project via Company Map Projects relation. Each project Adress place + lat/lng set; Location multi-select state-level (cities Andover/Lowell/West Haven/Orlando/Tampa/Kittery absent from options → state used; Tampa Air Cargo & East Selmon owners = Hillsborough authorities, NOT created — captured in body).*

## Owners/clients (9 — Owners DB `37990644`) ✅ created (each → General Contractors=Middlesex + Projects; Owners DB was near-empty pre-load)
MassDOT `…f73614c715fe` (4 proj) · CTDOT `…bcc2d2b3501af02a` (4) · MBTA `…824df51af204d89c` (3) · NAVFAC `…8696ce3142972bdd` (1) · FDOT `…89bef0d9bb0ca265` (2) · Brightline Trains LLC `…aafed346b43e6d95` (2) · GOAA `…8ed4de343553e28b` (2) · Eversource `…9355efe10408e0d4` (1) · Amtrak `…bd74c37f098fd206` (1). FL owners Location=[Other,USA] (no FL option in Owners DB).

## Other tables ✅ created
- **Events (4):** FTBA Annual Conference · DBIA-FL Design-Build Awards · CCIA Safety Recognition Awards (Location tags=[Connecticut]) · Middlesex Annual Charity Golf. All → company. No Place set (dossier gave no venue coords; Events Location tags lack FL/MA options).
- **Memberships (4):** CCIA · FTBA · DBIA-FL · ABC (25 consecutive STEP). All → company (**+added Companies relation col**).
- **Software (3 rows, shared Companies Software DB):** Trimble Stratus (Propeller)[Trimble] · Trimble GPS/Robotic TS/SCS900[Trimble] · Procore[Procore]. All → company, Location=[United States].
- **Locations (4):** Littleton MA HQ (→NE) · Meriden CT (→NE) · Orlando FL SE-HQ (→SE) · Tampa FL (→SE). All → company + division (**+added Companies + Division relation cols**); Adress text filled (table Adress is text, not place).
- **Sources (11):** key dossier sources added (overview/history, ENR Top 400, ENR $1.7B Navy, WALK, GLX, WBUR South Coast Rail, Propeller, Procore, CTDOT West Haven, Awards, Leadership).

## Audit — 2026-06-10 (post-load pass)
**Filled (1):** Kevin Bennett (People DB `37b90644-d524-81de-9574-f7d3fbb585b7`) → `Location` added `Florida` (was USA only; SE Region FL-based per dossier/RocketReach source). Confirmed write.
**DEFERRED — shared schema (Events Location tags):** `Florida` and `Massachusetts` options don't exist in the page-local Events DB multi-select (`collection://3f590644`). Per anti-clobber rules, adding new shared multi-select options is blocked. Affects: FTBA Annual Conference (FL), DBIA-FL Awards (FL), Charity Golf (MA) — all lack Location tags.
**DEFERRED — structural (People→Division):** People DB `Division` relation points to global Divisions DB (`collection://37690644-d524-8088-abd7-000b818a9b6b`) which holds KBE divisions only. Middlesex divisions live in the page-local Company Map (`collection://0ec90644`). Seth Whiteman, Kevin Bennett, Michael Iapaluccio, Jonathan Hebert have no `Division` set in People DB — structural mismatch, not a data gap.
**Genuinely sourceless (unchanged):** People LinkedIn (Seth Whiteman, Kevin Bennett, Jonathan Hebert — not in dossier) · People email/phone · FTBA event date (annual recurring, no specific date) · Events Place/venue coords · Mass Ready Mix address · Paving LLC Projects relation (paving-only projects not in Construction Projects DB) · division revenue/headcount/project counts · most project parcel/APN/FEMA/seismic.

## Left empty (no sourced value in dossier)
Division-level revenue/headcount/active-project counts · most project parcel/APN/permits/FEMA/seismic · exact license numbers · bond/surety · several project contract values (Brightline Zone 2, Tampa Air Cargo, I-75 Overpass, Niantic, SunRail, Needham, East Selmon — null in dossier) · Mass Ready Mix leader/address · people email/phone (dossier didn't give for the 4 leaders).

## Conflicts (kept existing, flagged)
- Company **Size=Local** (existing) vs dossier **Regional** — kept Local.
- Walk Bridge **$935M** (existing Cianbro page) vs dossier **$1.5B program** — kept existing; dossier value noted in brief.

## Interlink graph (verify by re-fetch)
Company ↔ People (4 new + 4 existing) · Company ↔ Construction Projects (21) · Division→Company (4) · Division→People + Division→Projects · Project→Contractors (Middlesex on all 21) · Location→Company + Division · Event→Company · Membership→Company · Software→Company.

## Manual UI steps outstanding  [TBD]
1. Projects Underway view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Middlesex.
2. Existing Software view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter.

## 2nd pass — 2026-06-10 (richer in-context dossier; additive)
**Source note:** a richer dossier appeared in-chat (NOT saved to disk; partially truncated) carrying an exec roster + extra software not in the registered disk file (which was already fully loaded). Zack chose **load new items additively**. Disk top-line ($566.7M/ENR #222, 2024 rev/2025 list) kept; context figures ($609.9M/#203) are a **different reporting year** (2023 rev/2024 list), not a true conflict — not overwritten.

**10 corporate execs created (People DB; Company→`1ce9…21c76` + NE Region division People):**

All corporate → homed to **Northeast Region** (Littleton HQ) division per existing precedent (Hebert). Company People now **18**; NE Region People now **12**. Dedup: none pre-existed in People DB (Strategy-CRM names were never People records; "Pereira" search hits = unrelated VINCI/Portugal people).

**Middlesex Asphalt LLC** division row created — `37b90644-d524-817a-ae03-f3e437e79f35` (Company Map; Companies rel → company). Was the one named member-company missing as a division (Paving + Mass Ready Mix already existed). No leader/address sourced.

**4 software signals created (Companies Software `37690644…804f`; Company-linked; Location=US):** Bluebeam Revu `…29a6c9f1d96aadaccc` [Bluebeam] · HCSS HeavyJob `…3c8cd3db220d24b430` [**no vendor tag — "HCSS" not in multi-select; avoided rewriting option set; named in title/body**] · Trimble Viewpoint Vista `…3484f7d535282fc5e9` [Trimble] · Primavera P6 `…81a0b5aac3984503fd08` [Primavera P6]. All from one Project Engineer job req (jobs.ourcareerpages.com/job/990386). Companies Software now **7**.

**Company body** Snapshot extended (additive): added "Named in job reqs" tool line + corporate-leadership line. Description/revenue/ENR/Size untouched.

**Not loaded (scope):** safety certs (ABC STEP Diamond/Gold 25+ yrs already on ABC membership; AQC 2025 available to add to ABC row if wanted) · enr_rank_history · richer federal FPDS PIID `N4008521C0077` (PNSY already captured). Bennett/Iapaluccio (SE/Paving leaders) were from the disk file, already loaded — not in this exec roster.

## Audit — 2026-06-13 (notion-audit skill pass #5 — current session)
**Target:** Operational hub `37b90644d5248003baf7e3d038b7c037` + TEMPLATE `37b90644d52480b2b047ef5e4b3a576a` + company record `1ce90644…21c76`.
**Result: 2 fills. All structural checks PASS.**

**Filled (verified pre- and post-write):**
- Operational hub body: **"30 people linked" → "417 people linked"** — company record `People` property has 417 URLs (Apollo CSV bulk import happened between pass #4 and this pass). [src](https://middlesexco.com/who-we-are/leadership/)
- TEMPLATE body: **"30 people linked" → "417 people linked"** — same Apollo bulk import; both body counters updated. [src](https://middlesexco.com/who-we-are/leadership/)

**Verified PASS — no write needed:**
- Company record: Description ✓, Website ✓, LinkedIn ✓, Address place ✓, BW Category ✓, Type (Company) ✓, Size (Regional) ✓, Country (7) ✓, People (417 relation) ✓, Construction Projects (23 in property, 24+ via Contractors backlink) ✓, Owners (12) ✓, Software (8) ✓.
- All 8 divisions: Companies ✓; Adress place ✓ on all 8; bodies full ✓.

**Note — project count:** Company record `Construction Projects` property shows 23 URLs; body says 24. Two additional projects (OIA GMP 5S.2 `37d90644…a39a3bcee9aa1019b0`, SR-429 `37d90644…f39c38c80f4a93adb7`) have Contractors = Middlesex but do not appear in the company property (likely one-directional relation display issue). Actual contractor-linked projects is ~25. Body counter left at 24 (as set by pass #4); full count audit deferred.
