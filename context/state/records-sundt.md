# State · Records — Sundt

> **Holds:** the Sundt dedup ledger — every record created/updated in the 2026-06-10 load, with Notion IDs, so the next session deduplicates before touching a Sundt record.
> **Ground truth:** `Enlaye Notion/Sundt/Sundt.md` (single-line JSON dossier; run_date 2026-06-10; 8 divisions · 18 projects · 15 locations · 2 events · 1 membership · 3 software · 50 sources · 24 gaps · NO people array). Dossier index: [research-files](research-files.md).
> **Part of:** [STATE.md](../../STATE.md) · map: [MAP.md](../MAP.md) · siblings: the other `records-*` ledgers.

Sassaman/Hageman/Odom/Yang/Brousseau + 10 `2fb90644…` rows).
- Filled this pass: Country +[Arizona, Texas, California, Tennessee, Washington, Florida] · body Company Snapshot + Sources (revenue/employees/ESOP/founded/ENR/HQ/IDIQ, sourced) · Construction Projects = 18 (one-way) · Companies Software = 3. People auto-grew 15→18.
- **Conflicts kept (existing wins):** Size=Regional (dossier=Multinational/"Mutlinational") · Description marketing copy (dossier one-liner added to body snapshot instead).

## Left empty (no sourced value in dossier — per 24-item gaps list)
Most project contract values (Cal Poly Pomona, rPlus, Data Center, APS Four Corners, Hermosa, Apache Junction); architect-of-record on several; division revenue/headcount; TRIR/EMR/DART; bonding/surety; permits/parcels/flood-zone; competing bidders; open-req counts; all place fields (no coords); people Email/Phone/LinkedIn.

## Interlink graph (verified by re-fetch 2026-06-10)
Company ↔ People (3 new + 15 existing = 18) ✓ · Company ↔ Construction Projects (18) ✓ · Company ↔ Software (3) ✓ · Division→Company (8) ✓ · Division→People (3: Charland/Buck/Reidy) ✓ · Division→Projects (18 mapped) ✓ · Project→Contractors (18) ✓ · Location→Company + Division (15) ✓ · Event→Company (2) ✓ · Membership→Company (1) ✓ · Software→Company (3) ✓. Project `Owning Department` deliberately empty (wrong-mechanism for page-local divisions); Person→Division N/A (People.Division targets a fixed other collection).

## Manual UI steps outstanding
1. **Projects Underway** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Sundt.
2. **Existing Software** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter.
3. Company Country → add **Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina** options (none exist; not added via MCP to avoid full-list clobber).
4. Construction Projects Location multi-select → add **Utah, New Mexico** if precise project-location tags wanted (used body instead; SLC/rPlus/Data Center/APS untagged).
5. Companies Software `Software used` → add **PSIcapture, Microsoft SharePoint** if tag wanted (in row Name/body for now).
6. Possible template guide rows on local tables — UI delete if Zack wants them gone.

## Audit — 2026-06-10 (second pass)
Full re-fetch of all records: company record, 8 divisions, 3 people, 18 projects, 2 events, 1 membership, 15 locations, data-source schemas. **No new fillable gaps found.**
- Division `place:Adress` still empty — write attempted, rejected (Notion place type requires lat/lng; dossier has none; no-geocoding rule confirmed).
- All relations, body content, properties confirmed intact from load session.
- Profile page (`37b90644…3af`) body retains template instruction text — non-destructive rule; no `replace_content` permitted without explicit confirmation.
- Genuinely sourceless blanks unchanged: place fields (no coords), division revenue/headcount, people email/phone/LinkedIn, DBIA event date, AGC event venue address, 5 project contract values.
- **Result: 0 writes, 0 new gaps filled, 0 data corrupted. Record is complete per available dossier data.**


## Audit — 2026-06-12 (third pass — /notion-audit Sundt)
Full re-fetch: company record, all linked tables (Divisions, Events, Memberships, Locations, Software, Projects). Workspace was substantially enriched by a subsequent session between 06-10 and 06-12.

### ⚠ Duplicate records flagged (non-destructive — cannot delete; Zack should clean via UI)
| Table | Dup records | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Locations | "Tempe Headquarters" `37b90644-d524-81e6-85cf-e4bb503a84a2` (original, has body) vs "Tempe HQ" `37d90644-d524-81f8-816c-efbc1f976755` (blank body, same address) | Retain original; delete new via UI |
| Locations | "Phoenix Operations Support Services" `37b90644-d524-81f2-ad5d-fcaa77e88c99` (original, has body) vs `37d90644-d524-8114-8c2c-e8dbd32e549b` AND `37d90644-d524-810a-b472-d132ceb0ee9d` (both blank bodies, same address) | Retain original; delete two new via UI |
| Memberships | "Associated General Contractors of America (AGC)" — 3 records: `37d90644-d524-811e-b8fc-fa65bc716c58` (has body) + `37d90644-d524-81e5-8e61-d9c95e3f1cdc` + `37d90644-d524-814c-8ff7-fda3024fb70a` (blank) | Retain first; delete two via UI |
| Memberships | "Arizona Builders Alliance" — 2 records: `37d90644-d524-8146-abe0-d82ef36fe939` (has body) + `37d90644-d524-819e-a255-d55764fbe062` | Retain first; delete second via UI |
| Memberships | "American Public Works Association (APWA)" — 2 records: `37d90644-d524-81f2-902d-c7ddbe28f8e6` (has body) + `37d90644-d524-817b-a5dd-ce8a49b5bb0c` | Retain first; delete second via UI |
| Projects | "I-10 Widening West Phase II" `37b90644-d524-8102-85cd-efb13a29614c` ($87M) vs "TxDOT I-10 Widening Phase II" `37d90644-d524-81a5-af38-c58e478f03a3` ($120M) — same source URL, different scope/name → possible same project re-created with different value; review before deleting |

### Orphan standalone page
- `37d90644-d524-810e-9a9c-fc8149ba1b6e` — blank-titled standalone Notion page (not in any DB) containing Concrete Division content identical to the DB row `37d90644-d524-8155-b8ec-ea2507ae6474`. The DB row is correct; this orphan should be deleted via UI.

### No new fillable gaps found from dossier
- Division `Adress` (place) still requires lat/lng → dossier has none → unchanged.
- All new records have company relation set ✓.
- DBIA event date still null (sourceless).
- place fields on all records remain empty (no coords; no-geocoding rule).
- **Result: 0 writes this pass. No dossier-sourceable gaps remain. Duplicate/orphan cleanup requires manual UI action.**

### Manual UI steps outstanding (cumulative)
1. **Dup cleanup** (see table above) — delete 2 Tempe HQ, 2 Phoenix Ops, 2 AGC, 1 AzBA, 1 APWA membership dups; orphan Concrete page.
2. **I-10 duplicate review** — determine if $87M vs $120M are the same project or different phases; merge or archive accordingly.
3. Projects Underway view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Sundt.
4. Existing Software view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter.
5. Country → Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina now present ✓ (resolved).
6. Construction Projects Location multi-select → add Idaho, Oregon options for new Northwest projects.

Full re-fetch: company record (schema + body), all 9 divisions, 4 memberships, 3 events, 15 locations schema, sample projects (SLC Water, APS Four Corners, Hermosa Mine). Companies DB schema confirmed (no Ownership/Founded/Revenue/Employees/ENR Rank properties — those fields don't exist in the schema; correctly in body only).

### New since 06-12
- **Company record Address (place)** — now filled: `place:Address:name=Sundt Construction HQ`, address=2620 S 55th St Tempe AZ 85282, lat=33.3979, lng=-111.9662. Previously flagged as outstanding; resolved by an intervening session. ✓
- **People count** — 835 people relations on company record (was ~18 dossier-sourced + 15 pre-existing; bulk growth reflects ongoing workspace enrichment from Apollo/LinkedIn imports).

### Checks performed (3a–3e)
- **3a Interconnection:** Company ↔ Divisions (9) ✓ · Divisions → Company (9) ✓ · Divisions → People ✓ · Divisions → Projects ✓ (where linked) · Events → Company (3) ✓ · Memberships → Company (4) ✓ · Locations → Company ✓. PoweR division has no People — dossier names no PoweR leader; genuinely sourceless.
- **3b Description depth:** All 9 division bodies confirmed rich with focus/leader/footprint/portfolio. Events have sourced bodies. Memberships have sourced bodies.
- **3c Address/location:** Company Address place = filled ✓. Division `Adress` (place type) = still empty; requires lat/lng; dossier has none; no-geocoding rule applies → genuinely sourceless. Location rows have Address text filled ✓.
- **3d Membership completeness:** 4 memberships present: DBIA ✓ · AGC ✓ · APWA ✓ · Arizona Builders Alliance ✓. Dossier names no additional memberships beyond these 4. Complete.
- **3e Location tags:** AGC Safety Award has Location tag "Arizona" ✓. DBIA Milestone has no date and no location tag — dossier gives no event date or location for the milestone; genuinely sourceless. Sundt Renewables Launch has no Location tag — event occurred Dec 2020, no specific venue in dossier; genuinely sourceless.

### No new fillable gaps found
- Companies DB schema has no Ownership/Founded/Revenue/Employees/ENR Rank properties — these don't exist; body-only is correct.
- DBIA event date null — sourceless (no date in dossier).
- Renewables Launch location tag — sourceless (no venue in dossier).
- Division place (Adress) — no coords, no-geocoding rule.
- PoweR division People — no leader named in dossier.
- Concrete division Projects — cross-company support group; no specific projects attributed in dossier.
- **Result: 0 writes this pass. Record complete per dossier. Dup/orphan cleanup (~8 records) still requires manual UI action.**

### Manual UI steps outstanding (cumulative — unchanged from 06-12)
1. **Dup cleanup** — delete 2 Tempe HQ, 2 Phoenix Ops, 2 AGC, 1 AzBA, 1 APWA membership dups; orphan Concrete page (`37d90644-d524-810e-9a9c-fc8149ba1b6e`).
2. **I-10 dup review** — $87M vs $120M same or different project.
3. Projects Underway view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter.
4. Existing Software view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter.
5. Construction Projects Location → add Idaho, Oregon options for Northwest projects.

## Audit — 2026-06-13 (fifth pass — /notion-audit Sundt)
Full re-fetch: company record, Memberships table (all rows), Events table (all rows), Locations table (schema + sample rows), Divisions (Advanced Facilities, Building Group, Mining + schema), sample projects (SLC Water, Building Group).

### Workspace growth since 06-13 (fourth pass)
- **Memberships** — now 5 rows: DBIA · AGC · APWA · Arizona Builders Alliance · **The Beavers** (`37d90644-d524-8118-9bc4-f7a3e08a57b9`, added ~06-12 19:07). All linked to company ✓.
- **Locations** — now 3 "Tempe Headquarters" rows: original `37b90644…81e6…` (with body) + `37d90644…81a6…` (blank body, same address, added ~06-12 20:06) + `37d90644…81f8…` ("Tempe HQ", added ~06-12 20:18). Two new dups beyond what 06-12 audit flagged.
- **Company record** confirmed healthy; all relations, properties as recorded.

### Checks performed (3a–3e)
- **3a Interconnection:** All 9 divisions → company ✓ · Events → company (3) ✓ · Memberships → company (5) ✓ · Locations → company ✓. No new gaps.
- **3b Description depth:** Divisions confirm rich bodies ✓. All sampled projects have sourced body content ✓.
- **3c Address/location:** Company Address place still filled ✓. Location `Adress` text field populated on original rows ✓. Division `Adress` (place type) still empty — no coords in dossier, no-geocoding rule → genuinely sourceless.
- **3d Membership completeness:** Dossier `memberships` array = 1 entry (DBIA only). The 4 additional memberships (AGC, APWA, Arizona Builders Alliance, The Beavers) were added by post-dossier enrichment sessions using sources outside the original dossier — valid enrichment, not dossier-sourced. Dossier is fully covered (DBIA ✓). No new dossier-sourced memberships to add.
