**"Jingoli Nuclear Services"** (renamed from "Jingoli TEMPLATE") — https://app.notion.com/p/37b90644d5248068a30ed33131821345 (Companies research → Zack Folder). Newer template variant: **Divisions** DB (not "Company Map"). Bio snapshot at top; Attack Plan filled at bottom. Icon `building_blue`.

Page-local data sources on this page:
- **Divisions** `collection://4f590644-d524-8375-b2e6-076d6a38735a` (props: Division title · Adress place · relations Companies full database / People / Projects)
- **Events** `collection://7df90644-d524-825b-97ac-079b32b5e078` (Event name · Date · Location tags · Place · Companies full database)
- **Sources** `collection://8a790644-d524-82bd-9609-07cf65f7fae4` ("What the source is about" · URL)
- **Locations** `collection://add90644-d524-8248-b15c-875a0c12bfa8` (Location · Adress text · **+added** Companies full database + Division relations)
- Linkedin Post `collection://5e490644-d524-825e-91ec-87ccc86fdae8` (unused) · Memberships `collection://ffb90644-d524-828c-a88d-87c74005ea00` (unused — dossier had none)
- Projects Underway = shared Construction Projects (linked view, filtered `__TEMPLATE__` — **manual UI filter fix needed**)
- Existing Software = shared Companies Software (linked view, filtered `__TEMPLATE__` — **manual UI filter fix needed**)

**Additive schema change (pre-authorized 2026-06-10):** added relations `Companies full database` + `Division` to the page-local Locations DB (was bare: Location · Adress only) — to complete the interlink.

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (`/notion-audit Jingoli`) — CONVERGED, zero writes
Full live re-verify of all 15 records vs `Jingoli.md` (company + 5 divisions + 2 people + 5 projects + 1 location + 1 event). Every record fetched live; every sourced field confirmed already populated. **No fillable gaps → no writes** (skill's "zero unnecessary writes").
- **Interconnection (3a) ✓:** all 5 divisions→company; Nuclear Services→Mockaitis + 5 projects; Power→Karl Miller; all 5 projects→Contractors; both people→company (+ in their division's People); Location→company+division; Event→company.
- **Description-depth (3b) ✓:** all 5 project bodies carry what/owner/value/scope/JV/dates; Power division body carries founded/phone/$17.5M/102-emp; people bodies carry role + context.
- **Address/location (3c):** place fields **genuinely unfillable** — dossier `lat:null/lng:null` everywhere; workspace `place` property rejects address-only (needs lat/lng); no-geocoding rule forbids inventing coords. Addresses live where a text field exists (Location row `Adress` text ✓) + in every body. Consistent w/ Bechtel/O&G/Dellbrook/Clayco place-blank precedent.
- **Deliberate scope boundaries (flagged, not written):** project `Owning Department` empty — relation targets Companies DB, not Divisions-DB rows; this template carries division↔project via `Divisions.Projects` (set on all 5), so Owning Department isn't the mechanism here (setting it = redundant w/ Contractors). `Owner` relation empty — Owner DB records out of scope per load (owner/client in each project body).

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (second run — `/notion-audit Jingoli` with `Jingoli1.md`) — 1 write
Full re-verify of all 16 records (added `Jingoli1.md` as second dossier). One fillable gap found and filled.
- **Filled (1):** Event `37b9…dc9dc` — `Location tags = ["New York"]` added. Schema change required first: added "New York" option (purple) to page-local Events DB (`collection://7df90644`) — all 9 existing options preserved. Source: `Jingoli.md` events[0].location_tags = ["New York"] / [ENR](https://enr.com/blogs/23-ny-construction-central/post/13801-jingoli-dco-named-region-s-contractor-of-the-year).
- **Interconnection (3a):** People `Division` relation still empty (Mockaitis + Karl Miller) — targets shared global Divisions DB (`collection://37690644-d524-8088-abd7-000b818a9b6b`), not page-local. No matching rows exist there. → DEFERRED (shared rows).
- **Address/location (3c):** unchanged — place fields genuinely unfillable (lat/lng null throughout both dossiers).
- **Memberships (3d):** none — both dossiers confirm null.
- **Software:** `Jingoli1.md` surfaces Procore, Oracle Primavera P6, Hard Dollar (broader Jingoli entity / nuclear job posts). Existing Software DB is shared → DEFERRED (shared rows).

## Record counts (updated)
Company (1) · Divisions (5) · People (4) · Projects (5) · Locations (2→3 rows, 1 dup pending) · Events (5→7 rows, 2 dup pending) · Memberships (4→8 rows, 4 dup pending) · Software (3) · Sources (14+)

## Manual UI steps outstanding
1. **Projects Underway** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Jingoli Nuclear Services.
2. **Existing Software** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter (now has 3 software rows).
3. Possible template guide rows on local tables (Divisions/Events/Sources/Locations) — UI delete if Zack wants them gone.
4. **Delete 9 duplicate rows (concurrent-session clobber, 2026-06-11)** — both sets now fully linked; delete the 11:07 batch:
   - Memberships: GBCA `37c90644-d524-8192-931c-d3b671d36ea3` · ACCNJ `37c90644-d524-81ad-9c94-caf4defe6ae3` · PWC NJ `37c90644-d524-81d7-a2a1-da72361a5271` · NJ Alliance `37c90644-d524-8118-ae22-ee0a1cba9af9`

## Audit pass 2026-06-11 (dup-cleanup pass — `notion-audit Jingoli Nuclear Services`) — 5 writes
Full live re-verify of all records. Found concurrent-session duplicate rows (two sessions ran 08:09 and 11:07 same day, both created same 4 memberships + 1 DCO location). The 08:09 batch had richer content but was missing company/division relations; the 11:07 batch had relations but thinner content.

**Fills (5):**
1. GBCA membership `37c90644…d88e25` (08:09) — added `Companies full database` → Jingoli Nuclear Services.
2. ACCNJ membership `37c90644…b59db3` (08:09) — added `Companies full database` → Jingoli Nuclear Services.
3. PWC NJ membership `37c90644…14091a` (08:09) — added `Companies full database` → Jingoli Nuclear Services.
4. NJ Alliance membership `37c90644…12994` (08:09) — added `Companies full database` → Jingoli Nuclear Services.
5. DCO Mays Landing location `37c90644…15959f` (08:09) — added `Division` → Jingoli-DCO.

**3a–3e ✓:** All checks pass (see prior session detail). **Pending manual dup deletion** (see UI steps #4 above) — MCP cannot trash pages.
**False positives rejected:** None — all 5 fills were genuine missing relations confirmed by live re-fetch before writing.
