**"Jingoli Nuclear Services"** (renamed from "Jingoli TEMPLATE") — https://app.notion.com/p/37b90644d5248068a30ed33131821345 (Companies research → Zack Folder). Newer template variant: **Divisions** DB (not "Company Map"). Bio snapshot at top; Attack Plan filled at bottom. Icon `building_blue`.

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (`/notion-audit Jingoli`) — CONVERGED, zero writes
Full live re-verify of all 15 records vs `Jingoli.md` (company + 5 divisions + 2 people + 5 projects + 1 location + 1 event). Every record fetched live; every sourced field confirmed already populated. **No fillable gaps → no writes** (skill's "zero unnecessary writes").
- **Interconnection (3a) ✓:** all 5 divisions→company; Nuclear Services→Mockaitis + 5 projects; Power→Karl Miller; all 5 projects→Contractors; both people→company (+ in their division's People); Location→company+division; Event→company.
- **Description-depth (3b) ✓:** all 5 project bodies carry what/owner/value/scope/JV/dates; Power division body carries founded/phone/$17.5M/102-emp; people bodies carry role + context.
- **Address/location (3c):** place fields **genuinely unfillable** — dossier `lat:null/lng:null` everywhere; workspace `place` property rejects address-only (needs lat/lng); no-geocoding rule forbids inventing coords. Addresses live where a text field exists (Location row `Adress` text ✓) + in every body. Consistent w/ Bechtel/O&G/Dellbrook/Clayco place-blank precedent.
- **Deliberate scope boundaries (flagged, not written):** project `Owning Department` empty — relation targets Companies DB, not Divisions-DB rows; this template carries division↔project via `Divisions.Projects` (set on all 5), so Owning Department isn't the mechanism here (setting it = redundant w/ Contractors). `Owner` relation empty — Owner DB records out of scope per load (owner/client in each project body).

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (second run — `/notion-audit Jingoli` with `Jingoli1.md`) — 1 write
Full re-verify of all 16 records (added `Jingoli1.md` as second dossier). One fillable gap found and filled.
- **Filled (1):** Event `37b9…dc9dc` — `Location tags = ["New York"]` added. Schema change required first: added "New York" option (purple) to page-local Events DB (`collection://7df90644`) — all 9 existing options preserved. Source: `Jingoli.md` events[0].location_tags = ["New York"] / [ENR](https://enr.com/blogs/23-ny-construction-central/post/13801-jingoli-dco-named-region-s-contractor-of-the-year).
- **Interconnection (3a):** People `Division` relation still empty (Mockaitis + Karl Miller) — targets shared global Divisions DB (`collection://37690644-d524-8088-abd7-000b818a9b6b`), not page-local. No matching rows exist there. → DEFERRED (shared rows).
- **Address/location (3c):** unchanged — place fields genuinely unfillable (lat/lng null throughout both dossiers).
- **Memberships (3d):** none — both dossiers confirm null.
- **Software:** `Jingoli1.md` surfaces Procore, Oracle Primavera P6, Hard Dollar (broader Jingoli entity / nuclear job posts). Existing Software DB is shared → DEFERRED (shared rows).

Full live re-verify of all 15 records (company DB record + 5 divisions + 2 people + 5 projects + 1 location + 1 event) + cross-check with `Jingoli1.md`. **2 fillable gaps found and filled — previously missed because prior passes only checked `Jingoli.md` (no lat/lng), not `Jingoli1.md` (HQ lat/lng present).**
- **Filled (2):**
  1. Company DB record `37b90644-d524-8127-824d-f2c6e9f55131` — `place:Address` → "100 Lenox Drive Suite 100, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648" (lat 40.2793 / lng -74.7263). Source: Jingoli1.md / jingoli.com/contact.

- **Location tags (3e):** Event "ENR NY Region Contractor of the Year" → [New York] ✓.
- **Duplicates observed (not fixed — destructive):** 2× ENR 2012 event rows (`37b9…81e7`, `37e9…81a9`); 2× HQ location rows (`37b9…810a`, `37e9…8166`).

## Manual UI steps outstanding
1. **Projects Underway** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Jingoli Nuclear Services.
2. **Existing Software** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter (now has 7 real rows — filter should show them).
3. Delete duplicate ENR 2012 event row (`37e90644-d524-81a9-a79c-c45a8d7fb1a5`) — duplicate of `37b9…81e7`.
4. Delete duplicate HQ location row (`37e90644-d524-8166-aeb9-f6c727613765`) — duplicate of `37b9…810a`.
5. Dedup GBCA membership rows (3 → 1): delete `37c90644-d524-81d8-8e25-f63da3126784` and `37d90644-d524-81c1-af0b-db58bc999958`; keep `37d90644-d524-81ea-9b4f-fc8a369845e8` (richest body with chapter/date).
6. Dedup PWC NJ membership rows (3 → 1): Zack to pick richest and delete others.
7. Review NJ Alliance for Action — multiple event rows + 1 membership row; confirm no additional dups.
