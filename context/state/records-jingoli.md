**"Jingoli Nuclear Services"** (renamed from "Jingoli TEMPLATE") — https://app.notion.com/p/37b90644d5248068a30ed33131821345 (Companies research → Zack Folder). Newer template variant: **Divisions** DB (not "Company Map"). Bio snapshot at top; Attack Plan filled at bottom. Icon `building_blue`.

- Projects Underway = shared Construction Projects (linked view, filtered `__TEMPLATE__` — **manual UI filter fix needed**)
- Existing Software = shared Companies Software (linked view, filtered `__TEMPLATE__` — **manual UI filter fix needed**)

**Additive schema change (pre-authorized 2026-06-10):** added relations `Companies full database` + `Division` to the page-local Locations DB (was bare: Location · Adress only) — to complete the interlink.

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (`/notion-audit Jingoli`) — CONVERGED, zero writes
Full live re-verify of all 15 records vs `Jingoli.md` (company + 5 divisions + 2 people + 5 projects + 1 location + 1 event). Every record fetched live; every sourced field confirmed already populated. **No fillable gaps → no writes** (skill's "zero unnecessary writes").
- **Interconnection (3a) ✓:** all 5 divisions→company; Nuclear Services→Mockaitis + 5 projects; Power→Karl Miller; all 5 projects→Contractors; both people→company (+ in their division's People); Location→company+division; Event→company.
- **Description-depth (3b) ✓:** all 5 project bodies carry what/owner/value/scope/JV/dates; Power division body carries founded/phone/$17.5M/102-emp; people bodies carry role + context.
- **Address/location (3c):** place fields **genuinely unfillable** — dossier `lat:null/lng:null` everywhere; workspace `place` property rejects address-only (needs lat/lng); no-geocoding rule forbids inventing coords. Addresses live where a text field exists (Location row `Adress` text ✓) + in every body. Consistent w/ Bechtel/O&G/Dellbrook/Clayco place-blank precedent.
- **Deliberate scope boundaries (flagged, not written):** project `Owning Department` empty — relation targets Companies DB, not Divisions-DB rows; this template carries division↔project via `Divisions.Projects` (set on all 5), so Owning Department isn't the mechanism here (setting it = redundant w/ Contractors). `Owner` relation empty — Owner DB records out of scope per load (owner/client in each project body).

## Audit pass 2026-06-10 (second run — `/notion-audit Jingoli` with `Jingoli1.md`) — 1 write
Full re-verify of all 16 records (added `Jingoli1.md` as second dossier). One fillable gap found and filled.
- **Filled (1):** Event `37b9…dc9dc` — `Location tags = ["New York"]` added. Schema change required first: added "New York" option (purple) to page-local Events DB (`collection://7df90644`) — all 9 existing options preserved. Source: `Jingoli.md` events[0].location_tags = ["New York"] / [ENR](https://enr.com/blogs/23-ny-construction-central/post/13801-jingoli-dco-named-region-s-contractor-of-the-year).
- **Interconnection (3a):** People `Division` relation still empty (Mockaitis + Karl Miller) — targets shared global Divisions DB (`collection://37690644-d524-8088-abd7-000b818a9b6b`), not page-local. No matching rows exist there. → DEFERRED (shared rows).
- **Address/location (3c):** unchanged — place fields genuinely unfillable (lat/lng null throughout both dossiers).
- **Memberships (3d):** none — both dossiers confirm null.
- **Software:** `Jingoli1.md` surfaces Procore, Oracle Primavera P6, Hard Dollar (broader Jingoli entity / nuclear job posts). Existing Software DB is shared → DEFERRED (shared rows).

## Audit pass 2026-06-13 Pass #6 (`/notion-audit Jingoli Nuclear Services`) — 2 FILLS
Full live re-verify of all 15 records (company DB record + 5 divisions + 2 people + 5 projects + 1 location + 1 event) + cross-check with `Jingoli1.md`. **2 fillable gaps found and filled — previously missed because prior passes only checked `Jingoli.md` (no lat/lng), not `Jingoli1.md` (HQ lat/lng present).**
- **Filled (2):**
  1. Company DB record `37b90644-d524-8127-824d-f2c6e9f55131` — `place:Address` → "100 Lenox Drive Suite 100, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648" (lat 40.2793 / lng -74.7263). Source: Jingoli1.md / jingoli.com/contact.
  2. Division `37b90644-d524-8176-9b58-e01587bd5333` (Nuclear Services market-sector unit) — `place:Adress` → same address + coords. Source: Jingoli1.md / documents.dps.ny.gov.
- **Project Adress fills attempted (5) — rejected:** dossier lat/lng = null for all project sites; Notion place validation requires lat/lng; no-geocoding rule blocks fabrication. All 5 remain genuinely unfillable.
- **Interconnection (3a) ✓:** all 5 divisions→company; Nuclear Services→Mockaitis+11 projects; Jingoli Power→Karl Miller+5 projects; all 5 dossier projects→Contractors+Owning Department; both people→company; Location→company+division; Event→company.
- **Description-depth (3b) ✓:** all bodies at full sourced depth.
- **Address/location (3c):** Company Address place now filled ✓; Nuclear Services division Adress now filled ✓; 4 other division Adress empty (no physical offices — market-sector units, sourceless). Project Adress genuinely unfillable (lat/lng null in both dossiers).
- **Memberships (3d):** none — `Jingoli.md` memberships array all-null; `Jingoli1.md` memberships belong to parent entity JINGOLI/Joseph Jingoli & Son (not nuclear subsidiary). Complete ✓.
- **Location tags (3e):** Event "ENR NY Region Contractor of the Year" → [New York] ✓.
- **Duplicates observed (not fixed — destructive):** 2× ENR 2012 event rows (`37b9…81e7`, `37e9…81a9`); 2× HQ location rows (`37b9…810a`, `37e9…8166`).

## Manual UI steps outstanding
1. **Projects Underway** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter, set Contractors = Jingoli Nuclear Services.
2. **Existing Software** view → clear `__TEMPLATE__` filter (table is empty — no software to show).
3. Possible template guide rows on local tables (Divisions/Events/Sources/Locations) — UI delete if Zack wants them gone.
4. Delete duplicate ENR 2012 event row (`37e90644-d524-81a9-a79c-c45a8d7fb1a5`) — duplicate of `37b9…81e7`.
5. Delete duplicate HQ location row (`37e90644-d524-8166-aeb9-f6c727613765`) — duplicate of `37b9…810a`.
