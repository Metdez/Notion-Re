## Harvard Departments — Company subsidiary hierarchy (2026-06-08)
Departments are **Companies** (BW Category `Owner`), nested under parent **Harvard University** via `Parent Company`⇄`Subsidiaries`. Each links to the Harvard owner via the new **`Owner Institution`**⇄ Owners **`Departments`** relation, and to its projects via the new **`Owned Projects`**⇄ Projects **`Owning Department`** relation. People link via `Company`. Varied emoji icons. **Two new relations added** to keep departments out of the GC `Contractors`/`General Contractors` fields.

- Harvard Office for Sustainability — `Description` was empty → filled
- Harvard Office of the EVP — `Description` was empty → filled
- Harvard FAS — `Description` corrected (removed erroneous "12 Palmer Street" attribution)

**No fills (genuinely sourceless):**

- NASDEP / Steam Tunnel 29/30 `place:Adress` — no single precise street address in source
- Lewis International Law Center address — dossier gives campus area only, no street number
- All `LinkedIn` fields on departments — not in source
- All `Website` fields on departments — not in source

**3a check:** all owner↔department↔project edges intact. No missing relation edges.
**3b check:** all project bodies complete; department bodies adequate.
**3d memberships:** N/A (Owner entity, no memberships table).
**3e location tags:** all project Location fields populated; no missing tags.

**13th project found:** Lewis International Law Center Renovation `37b90644-d524-8198-a97e-fefc1444e834` (Shawmut GC, added after initial build from Shawmut dossier — not in original ledger). Owning dept: `37b90644-d524-811c-9937-c91b1e37bf88` (Harvard Law School, separate company — not in this ledger).

## Audit log — 2026-06-12
**Fill:**
- NASDEP Status `In progress` → `Done` — source: [Allston Development Update Oct 2025](https://construction.harvard.edu/2025/11/04/allston-development-update-october-2025/) confirms substantially complete / close-out.

**No fills (genuinely sourceless or already filled):**
- All 15 project `place:Adress` fields already populated (except NASDEP/Steam Tunnel 29/30 which have no street address in dossier — confirmed sourceless).
- All 26+ people `LinkedIn` fields: already set where sourced (Lisa Giovanetti, Sarah Henning, Tory Wolcott Green, Alyssa Hubbard, John Martell, David Armitage, Anne-Sophie Divenyi, Tom O'Connor). Remaining people (HALC leadership, HMS team, CSL team) have no public LinkedIn URLs in either dossier.
- Email fields already complete on CSL team (Edward LeFlore, Ann Davis, Nicole Clement, Holly Sutherland, Shane O'Halloran) and Purnima Kapur. No new emails found in dossier for remaining people.
- Pritzker Hall/Lewis Law Center date fields: start/end not in dossier for Lewis; Pritzker already set.
- 12 Palmer Street / Barker Center status: targeted for completion ~Apr–Jun 2026 per dossier, but actual completion not confirmed in source — Status left as "In progress."
- ART/Goel Center end date: body notes "expected 2027" for ART theater itself but property shows 2026-10-31 (for combined package with 100 SCD housing). Ambiguous; not updated.

**Flags (non-destructive, for Zack):**
- **Duplicate Gund Hall records:** `37c90644-d524-8159-a591-c390f06ce2e3` and `37c90644-d524-813f-98c8-efd5cad0f266` are both "George Gund Hall Renovation — Harvard GSD." First has Owning Department + more data; second is a thinner duplicate. Cannot delete per safety rules — Zack should manually archive/delete the second one.
- Gund Hall `Owning Department` on first record (`37c90644-d524-8159`) points to `37b90644-d524-811c` which is actually the "Shawmut — New England Region" Division record (not a Harvard dept) — this is by design, reflecting the project's origin in the Shawmut dossier.

**3a check:** All owner↔department↔project relation edges intact across all 15 projects and 26 people. No missing edges found.
**3b check:** All project bodies complete; no thin bodies where source has more detail.
