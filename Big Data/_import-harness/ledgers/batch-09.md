## NOTE — environment blocker (2026-06-10 ~19:35)
Notion MCP is returning persistent HTTP 429 (`mcp_tool_rate_limit`, "try again in a few minutes") on nearly every call — only ~1 call succeeds before a multi-minute cooldown. With 18 agents + the hourly cron audit sharing one Notion MCP, per-record dedup-search+create for 2500 rows is not achievable in a single run at this rate. Proceeding by: resolve each distinct company once (cached above), then import people in small resumable chunks, advancing the cursor after each chunk. If 429s persist, set Status `blocked` with this note so a human/coordinator can throttle the fleet.
